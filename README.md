# Policy Gradient Termination

## Experiments for strongly polynomial
We have a simple script to automatically generate settings and run.
```
python script/2024_10_15/exp_0.py --setup --full # use --work to make sure it runs with 1 seed
python script/2024_10_15/exp_0.py --run # -use --sub_runs x,y to run experiments [x,y).
```
The data is saved in the folder `logs/2024_10_15/exp_0`, and there should be 63 total experiments.
You can see `settings/2024_10_15/exp_0` for the configuration of each experiment.
